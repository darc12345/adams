# Project ADAMS: Adaptive Air Monitoring System 🌍🛵

**ADAMS** is an innovative solution designed to passively monitor air quality in real-time for motorcycle drivers through a compact wearable device worn like a wristwatch. Developed for the **Google Solution Challenge 2025**, ADAMS aims to help drivers stay informed and motivated toward healthier driving habits through technology they already use.

- **Daily Reports**: Summarizes work duration, routes, and air quality trends with AI-generated feedback.
- **Weekly Reports**: Aggregates data to show long-term trends and improvements.

### 🗺️ **Global Heatmap**
- Visualizes regional air quality using interpolated data from drivers' sensors.
- Color-coded zones (green/yellow/red) to highlight pollution levels.

### 🔔 **Notification System**
- Alerts drivers when they spend too much time in high-pollution (red) zones.

### 🔥 **Streaks, Points & Rewards System**
- **Streak System**: Earn points for driving in less dense zones (green > yellow > red).
